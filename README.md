# daily-journal

Daily journal is a webpage created to input daily journal entries while I attend Nashville Software School. It will contain the ability to file the date of the entry, the concepts covered that day, a journal entry with thoughts from the day or newly learned material and a meter on how I feel that day to track moods as well as a button to record the entry. 

## Project Status

The daily journal is still under development and will be completed sometime around christmas 2020. 

## Usage

This could be used by anyone looking to save a daily journal while they learn new concepts and track their mood while doing so. 

## Support

Support for this website is accessible by emailing me at MixonRobertH@gmail.com

## Roadmap

Going forward, I am looking to add a save function to store the data in the journal.
